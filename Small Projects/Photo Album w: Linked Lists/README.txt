When the program is ran it is going to access the images folder which currently (my tester) has 6 images of 3 different types 
(png,jpg, gif). After accessing the folder a linked list is created and from each file the name, file path, and file size is 
read and saved into a node that is then added into the list. My linked list is doublt linked circularly so as each node is created
there is a link linking it from the node that come befores it to it and then it to the node that comes after. In the case of the 
last node then it would link back to the beginning of the list.  To exit just exit the panel. 

I had some issues in the very beginning with the project. I was struggling to use the swing items because I wasn't sure what did what
exactly. Once I figured that out everything else was pretty easy to add in once I drawed out some pathing.

I implemented the ImageDisplayStarter.java that you gave us. I used the javaAPI and stack overflow to learn more about the methods 
that were needed in the project for Swing since I was struggling with it . None of the code was copied from it, it was just used 
as a learning resource for what the methods needed as a parameter and what it returned since I learn better from example.
