This pipelined processor was created in Digital to create processor components without physically attaching wires and instead creating them to learn the process and learn how each component works at it's base level. This was a long project that had multiple different builds starting from a simple adder and growing bigger from there. This project helped in creating the basis for how processors work and why the architecture is built in certain ways. Included in this is how technology has changed overtime to create better architecture.
