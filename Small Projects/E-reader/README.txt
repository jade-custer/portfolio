The Ereader I created allows readers to look through the bookstore library and purchase books. Then of which they are able to 
read forward and backwards 20 lines as well as searching the text file for a certain phrase. I used 3 total classes. purchasedBooks
is the class I used to read the text files and iterate through different features that was used for purchased books. bookstore is
where I created the bookstore arrayList and let the user to be able to purchase books that would later get added to their own arrayList
library. The final class is frequent which was used to story the frequency and word to aid in getting the top 10 most frequent words
that of which I struggled with and didn't ultimately end up finishing.
