-How website works 
	-First chart will not load until scrolling happens
		-Datawrapper chart has to get reloaded in each time you see it so give it a second to load 
	-As you scroll the charts will load in based on the subtitles on the right side. 
		-Tooltips work with hover and after hovering they disappear.

-Quick Change Tips
	-Margins and width/height is global for the svgs so if all of the charts have to resized its a quick fix.
	-Each chart is in a draw function so if anything about a particular chart needs to be changed or moved look for the function
		-An exception is the Datawrapper chart that loads in from an embed.
